Slavery is referred to several times throughout the story , as critic Nan Goodman noted ; as a post @-@ Civil War work , The Monster revisits slavery 's legacy , as well as its effects on modern African Americans like Henry Johnson . At the beginning of the story , it is made clear that the white townspeople tolerate Henry because he \" behaves himself \" and \" knows his place \" as a black man . Later , when Henry struggles through the burning house to save Jimmie , it is said that \" he was submitting , submitting because of his fathers , bending his mind in a most perfect slavery to this conflagration . \" However , while his suffering is tantamount to the story , Henry Johnson is never really fleshed out as a character ; before the fire , he \" strikes in quick succession the minstrel 's poses of an old @-@ time , happy @-@ go @-@ lucky Negro \" , who charms children and women alike . Despite his heroism , Morgan stated , Henry does not stray far from a racial stereotype . Critics such as Lillian Gilkes and John R.

    "text": "Below Frodsham , barges carrying salt had to negotiate a tidal section of the river to reach the Mersey , from where the cargo would be taken to Liverpool or Manchester for distribution worldwide . Water levels were inadequate for the Mersey Flats at neap tides , resulting in them having to wait for days at Frodsham . In 1796 , users of the navigation suggested that it should be extended to Weston Point , where the water was deeper . The trustees wanted to pay for this extension by raising tolls , but the users objected , and it took several years to work out a deal which suited both parties . Finally , the Trustees obtained a third Act on 8 August 1807 , which authorised the construction of a cut from Frodsham to Weston Point . The trustees insisted that their own engineer , John Johnson , should oversee the work , but the project was too large for him , and ran over time and budget . He was sacked in 1809 , after serving the navigation for 29 years , and Thomas Telford was asked to complete the work . He managed the project with Samuel Fowls as engineer . At Weston Point , a new lock connected the cut to a basin , and tide gates connect the basin to the Mersey . This cut was called the Weston Canal and was completed in 1810 . A fourth Act was obtained on 2 May 1825 , which altered some of the details of the previous Act , and an Act of 22 May 1829 noted that the Weston Canal had been completed . It stated that the Trustees had built a basin , piers and a lighthouse at Weston Point , that the Weston Canal was officially a branch of the River Weaver , and that the Trustees would make no additional charges for using the section . No tolls had been collected since 1816 , once the construction costs had been repaid ."

He felt that it worked \" pretty well \" and there was a lot to appreciate about it , and while he noted that \" the episode isn 't quite good enough for the conclusion to be as devastating as it should be \" , he still praised the tragic ending . However , he felt it not believable that Mulder quickly accepts his past lives and Melissa 's part in it , and thought it would have worked better if he eased into believing it . Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a largely positive review and awarded it three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half stars out of four . She called the entry \" unabashedly emotional episode \" that is \" unafraid to plumb the depths of human loss and grief \" . Furthermore , Vitaris praised Cloke 's acting ; she called her \" a truly gifted actor , slipping faultlessly into the skin of all of Melissa 's personalities . \" She was , however , more critical of Duchovny , noting that his hypnosis scene was underacted . Sarah Stegall , in The Munchkyn Zone , gave the episode a 5 out 5 rating . Stegall wrote that while the episode is \" drowned in tears and soaked in muted sunlight , [ and ] teeters on the brink of sentimentality \" , it manages \" to stay just this side of it for a dynamite , gripping episode that showcases some fine actors \" ."

A study of this phenomenon concluded that goats and sheep are short @-@ day breeders . Mating in most sheep breeds begins in summer or early autumn . Mating in sheep is also affected by melatonin , that advances the onset of the breeding season ; and thyroxine , that terminates the breeding season . Estrus lasts for at most a day in bovids , with the exception of bovines and tragelaphines . Except the hartebeest and the topi , all bovids can detect estrus in females by testing the urine using the vomeronasal organ . Once the male is assured that the female is in estrus , he begins courtship displays ; these displays vary greatly from the elaborate marches among gregarious species to the fervent licking of female genitalia among solitary species . Females , initially not receptive , ultimately mates with the male which has achieved dominance over others . Receptiveness is expressed by permission for mounting by the male and setting aside the tail by the female . Copulation generally takes a few seconds ."

    "text": "The rapid thinning , acceleration and retreat of Helheim , Jakobshavns and Kangerdlugssuaq glaciers in Greenland , all in close association with one another , suggests a common triggering mechanism , such as enhanced surface melting due to regional climate warming or a change in forces at the glacier front . The enhanced melting leading to lubrication of the glacier base has been observed to cause a small seasonal velocity increase and the release of meltwater lakes has also led to only small short term accelerations . The significant accelerations noted on the three largest glaciers began at the calving front and propagated inland and are not seasonal in nature . Thus , the primary source of outlet glacier acceleration widely observed on small and large calving glaciers in Greenland is driven by changes in dynamic forces at the glacier front , not enhanced meltwater lubrication . This was termed the Jakobshavns Effect by Terence Hughes at the University of Maine in 1986 . Indeed , a study published in 2015 on glacial underwater topography at 3 sites found cavities , due to warm subglacial water intrusion , which has been identified as a possible dominant force for ablation ( surface erosion ) .

For example , injection of a flux of a liquid crystal between two close parallel plates ( viscous fingering ) causes orientation of the molecules to couple with the flow , with the resulting emergence of dendritic patterns . This anisotropy is also manifested in the interfacial energy ( surface tension ) between different liquid crystal phases . This anisotropy determines the equilibrium shape at the coexistence temperature , and is so strong that usually facets appear . When temperature is changed one of the phases grows , forming different morphologies depending on the temperature change . Since growth is controlled by heat diffusion , anisotropy in thermal conductivity favors growth in specific directions , which has also an effect on the final shape ."

After several foiled attempts to locate a suitable anchorage , and with its rudder seriously damaged by ice , the ship finally found a sheltered bay on the southern shore of Laurie Island , the most easterly of the South Orkneys chain . On 25 March the ship safely anchored , settling into the ice a quarter of a mile ( 400m ) from shore . She was then rapidly converted to winter quarters , with engines dismantled , boilers emptied , and a canvas canopy enclosing the deck . Bruce instituted a comprehensive programme of work , involving meteorological readings , trawling for marine samples , botanical excursions , and the collection of biological and geological specimens . The major task completed during this time was the construction of a stone building , christened \" Omond House \" , after Robert Omond , director of the Edinburgh Observatory who was a supporter of the expedition . This building provided living accommodation for the parties that would remain on Laurie Island to operate the proposed meteorological laboratory . The building was constructed from local materials using the dry stone method , with a roof improvised from wood and canvas sheeting . The completed house had a footprint of 20 by 20 feet ( 6 by 6 m ) , with two windows , fitted as quarters for six people . Rudmose Brown wrote : \" Considering that we had no mortar and no masons ' tools it is a wonderfully fine house and very lasting . I should think it will be standing a century hence ... \""

In sequential files , records are contiguous and must be traversed sequentially , similarly to a linked list . Indexed files have one or more indexes which allow records to be randomly accessed and which can be sorted on them . Each record must have a unique key , but other , alternate , record keys need not be unique . Implementations of indexed files vary between vendors , although common implementations , such as C \u2011 ISAM and VSAM , are based on IBM 's ISAM . Relative files , like indexed files , have a unique record key , but they do not have alternate keys . A relative record 's key is its ordinal position ; for example , the 10th record has a key of 10 . This means that creating a record with a key of 5 may require the creation of ( empty ) preceding records . Relative files also allow for both sequential and random access ."

Two boys , 16 and 17 years old , later supported the 14 @-@ year @-@ old 's claim . The boys claimed trauma from the experience , seeking charges against the filmmakers including infliction of emotional distress , negligence , and invasion of privacy . Allegations were made that the boys were filmed for sexual gratification . The local news shows and national tabloid programs stirred the controversy . A sexual crimes task force that included local , state , and federal personnel investigated the incident . The Los Angeles District Attorney 's office determined that there was no cause to file criminal charges , stating , \" The suspects were intent on completing a professional film as quickly and efficiently as possible . There is no indication of lewd or abnormal sexual intent . \" The civil case was dismissed due to insufficient evidence . The scene was filmed again with adult actors so the film could finish on time ."

This was out of the question for Hastings ; thanks to the cost of his call to the Bar , he was so poor that his wig and robes had to be bought on credit . Instead he wandered around Middle Temple and by chance ran into Frederick Corbet , the only practising barrister he knew . After Hastings explained his situation , Corbet offered him a place in his set of chambers , which Hastings immediately accepted . Although he now had a place in chambers , Hastings had no way of getting a pupillage ( Corbet only dealt with Privy Council cases ) and he instead decided to teach himself by watching cases at the Royal Courts of Justice . Hastings was lucky : the first case he saw involved Rufus Isaacs , Henry Duke and Edward Carson , three of the most distinguished English barristers of the early 20th century . For the next six weeks until the court vacation , Hastings followed these three barristers from court to court \" like a faithful hound \" ."

His view that Berg had taken serialism as far as it could go and that Schoenberg 's music was now \" desert , stone soup , ersatz music , or poetic vitamins \" earned him the enmity of composers such as Pierre Boulez .

The inaugural volume of poetry was preceded by a prose preface of 827 lines . The succeeding untitled twelve poems totaled 2315 lines \u2014 1336 lines belonging to the first untitled poem , later called \" Song of Myself \" . The book received its strongest praise from Ralph Waldo Emerson , who wrote a flattering five @-@ page letter to Whitman and spoke highly of the book to friends . The first edition of Leaves of Grass was widely distributed and stirred up significant interest , in part due to Emerson 's approval , but was occasionally criticized for the seemingly \" obscene \" nature of the poetry .

In 1929 , Harry and Caresse Crosby , owners of the Black Sun Press , contacted James Joyce through bookstore owner Sylvia Beach and arranged to print three short fables about the novel 's three children Shem , Shaun and Issy that had already appeared in translation . These were \" The Mookse and the Gripes \" , \" The Triangle \" , and \" The Ondt and the Gracehoper \" . The Black Sun Press named the new book Tales Told of Shem and Shaun for which they paid Joyce US $ 2 @,@ 000 for 600 copies , unusually good pay for Joyce at that time . Their printer Roger Lescaret erred when setting the type , leaving the final page with only two lines . Rather than reset the entire book , he suggested to the Crosby 's that they ask Joyce to write an additional eight lines to fill in the remainder of the page . Caresse refused , insisting that a literary master would never alter his work to fix a printer 's error . Lescaret appealed directly to Joyce , who promptly wrote the eight lines requested . The first 100 copies of Joyce 's book were printed on Japanese velum and signed by the author . It was hand @-@ set in Caslon type and included an abstract portrait of Joyce by Constantin Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i , a pioneer of modernist abstract sculpture .

His aggressive campaign against organized crime successfully removed many drug cartel leaders from Mexico 's leading drug trafficking organizations . However , his strategy has also been criticized for sparking more violence . When a drug baron is arrested or killed , the criminal organization may experiences a leadership void , which leads to infighting for succession , possible fragmentation , and new competition from other crime syndicates . This practice , commonly referred to as the \" kingpin strategy \" , worked to bring down the hegemony of the Cali and the Medell\u00edn Cartels in Colombia in the 1990s . But its implementation in Mexico has brought more violence and has led to instability in the criminal underworld . However , the Mexican government provides a different interpretation of the strategy . They suggest that violence does not increase in Mexico 's already violent states , and that troops are sent when violence already exists in an area . Therefore , the strategy is a product , not the cause , of the violence ."

With the opening in 1900 of the Central London Railway from Shepherd 's Bush to the City with a flat fare of 2d , the District and the Met together lost four million passengers between the second half of 1899 and the second half of 1900 . The polluted atmosphere in the tunnels was becoming increasingly unpopular with passengers and conversion to electric traction was seen as the way forward . Electrification had been considered by the Met as early as the 1880s , but such a method of tracton was still in its infancy , and agreement would be needed with the District because of the shared ownership of the Inner Circle . A jointly owned train of six coaches ran an experimental passenger service on the Earl 's Court to High Street Kensington section for six months in 1900 . This was considered a success , tenders were requested and in 1901 a Met and District joint committee recommended the Ganz three @-@ phase AC system with overhead wires . This was accepted by both parties until the Underground Electric Railways Company of London ( UERL ) took control of the District . The UERL was led by the American Charles Yerkes , whose experience in the United States led him to favour DC with a third rail similar to that on the City & South London Railway and Central London Railway . After arbitration by the Board of Trade a DC system with four rails was taken up and the railways began electrifying using multiple @-@ unit stock and electric locomotives hauling carriages . In 1904 , the Met opened a 10 @.@ 5 MW coal @-@ fired power station at Neasden , which supplied 11 kV 33 @.@ 3 Hz current to five substations that converted this to 600 V DC using rotary converters ."

Zermelo 's theorem states that it is possible to solve chess , i.e. to determine with certainty the outcome of a perfectly played game ( either white can force a win , or black can force a win , or both sides can force at least a draw ) . However , according to Claude Shannon , there are 1043 legal positions in chess , so it will take an impossibly long time to compute a perfect strategy with any feasible technology ."

    "text": "Several studies have shown that problems with joint attention are associated with developmental processes . Difficulties in establishing joint attention may partially account for differences in social abilities of children with developmental disorders ( i.e. Autism spectrum disorders ) . A core deficit noted in autism is eye gaze . Autistic children have difficulty alternating their attention towards a partner and third object . This difficulty is attributed to their deficiencies in following gaze , resulting in difficulty initiating and maintaining joint attention . Deaf infants are able to engage in joint attention similar to hearing infants ; however , the time spent engaged in joint attention is often reduced in deaf infants born to hearing parents . Hearing parents of deaf infants often are less likely to respond and expand on their deaf infants ' initiative and communicative acts . Deaf infants of deaf parents do not show reduced time spent in joint attention . Auditory input is not critical to joint attention but similar modes of communication and understanding are vital . Furthermore , mothers who are unable to successfully establish regular joint attention with their child rate that infant lower on scales of social competence . Judgement of low social competence can be made as early as 18 months of age . In blind infants , joint attention is established by means of auditory input or feeling another person 's hand on an object and may be delayed compared to sighted infants ."

According to former longtime associate Fritz Manes , as quoted by author McGilligan , Eastwood was devoted to her between 1976 and 1980 at the least , but discreetly kept up several \" maintenance relationships \" ( such as with Tunis ) during that period . McGilligan claims Eastwood returned to his \" habitual womanizing \" in the early 1980s , becoming involved with story analyst Megan Rose , actress Jamie Rose ( who played a bit part in Tightrope ) , animal rights activist Jane Brolin ( who had intermittent liaisons with Eastwood between the early 1960s and late 1980s ) and Jacelyn Reeves , a stewardess he met at the Hog 's Breath Inn , among others . He was still living with Locke when he conceived two children with Reeves : a son Scott Eastwood ( born Scott Reeves ; March 21 , 1986 ) and daughter Kathryn Eastwood ( born Kathryn Reeves ; February 2 , 1988 ) , whose birth certificates both said \" Father declined . \" The affair with Reeves was not reported anywhere until an expos\u00e9 article was published in the Star tabloid in 1990 , though the children still went unmentioned by mainstream news sources for more than a decade thereafter . Eastwood 's relationship with Locke ( at the time unaware of his infidelities ) ended acrimoniously in April 1989 , and the post @-@ breakup litigation dragged on for years . Locke filed a palimony lawsuit against him after he changed the locks on their home and moved her possessions into storage when she was away filming her second directorial effort Impulse . In court , Eastwood downplayed the intensity of their relationship . He described Locke as a \" roommate \" before quickly redescribing her as a \" part @-@ time roommate . \" Locke 's estranged brother told The Tennessean that Eastwood still truly loved her , but could no longer take her \" addiction \" to husband Gordon Anderson . Anticipating that Eastwood was going to misrepresent the marriage , Locke asked Anderson to surrender all claims on any of her assets that as her legal spouse he was entitled to . \" In an extraordinary gesture of love and faith in me , Gordon signed away everything without hesitation . \" During the trial , an investigative journalist contacted Locke and informed her of Eastwood 's other family . \" I spoke with the nurse in the delivery room , and she confirmed that they are Clint 's children . I 'll send copies of the birth certificates to you and a photo of Jacelyn , if you want them , \" Locke quotes the informant . \" My mind was still searching to get all his actions lined up . For at least the last four years of our relationship , Clint had been living this double life , going between me and this other woman , and having children with her . Two babies had been born during the last three years of our relationship , and they weren 't mine . \" Locke dropped the suit in 1990 in exchange for a directing deal at Warner Bros. , but sued Eastwood again for fraud in 1994 when she became convinced the deal was a sham , finally settling out of court in September 1996 . Since then , Locke has made discrediting comments about Eastwood ."

    "text": "Charles Darwin was aware of the severe reaction in some parts of the scientific community against the suggestion made in Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation that humans had arisen from animals by a process of transmutation . Therefore , he almost completely ignored the topic of human evolution in On the Origin of Species . Despite this precaution , the issue featured prominently in the debate that followed the book 's publication . For most of the first half of the 19th century , the scientific community believed that , although geology had shown that the Earth and life were very old , human beings had appeared suddenly just a few thousand years before the present . However , a series of archaeological discoveries in the 1840s and 1850s showed stone tools associated with the remains of extinct animals . By the early 1860s , as summarized in Charles Lyell 's 1863 book Geological Evidences of the Antiquity of Man , it had become widely accepted that humans had existed during a prehistoric period \u2014 which stretched many thousands of years before the start of written history . This view of human history was more compatible with an evolutionary origin for humanity than was the older view . On the other hand , at that time there was no fossil evidence to demonstrate human evolution . The only human fossils found before the discovery of Java Man in the 1890s were either of anatomically modern humans or of Neanderthals that were too close , especially in the critical characteristic of cranial capacity , to modern humans for them to be convincing intermediates between humans and other primates ."

Little Prairie was homesteaded by Alexander and Lillan Windrem in 1930 and cleared the land by 1935 for hay , oats and gardens . Oil and coal discoveries , west of Little Prairie , near Commotion Creek , led to the construction of area roads .

Murray thus often travelled to the museum to catalogue these artefacts , and during the 1906 \u2013 07 school year regularly lectured there .

Murray was particularly keen to emphasise the importance that the unwrapping would have for the scholarly understanding of the Middle Kingdom and its burial practices , and lashed out against members of the public who saw it as immoral ; she declared that \" every vestige of ancient remains must be carefully studied and recorded without sentimentality and without fear of the outcry of the ignorant \" . She subsequently published a book about her analysis of the two bodies , The Tomb of the Two Brothers , which remained a key publication on Middle Kingdom mummification practices into the 21st century ."

This method is often called \" cardioid subwoofer array \" or \" CSA \" even though the pattern of all directional subwoofer methods is cardioid . The CSA method reverses the enclosure orientation and inverts the polarity of one out of every three subwoofers across the front of the stage , and delays those enclosures for maximum cancellation of the target frequency on stage . Polarity inversion can be implemented electronically , by reversing the wiring polarity , or by physically positioning the enclosure to face rearward .

    "text": "Livestock depredation has been one of the primary reasons for hunting wolves , and can pose a severe problem for wolf conservation : as well as causing economic losses , the threat of wolf predation causes great stress on livestock producers , and no foolproof solution of preventing such attacks short of exterminating wolves has been found . Some nations help offset economic losses to wolves through compensation programmes or state insurance . Domesticated animals are easy prey for wolves , as they have evolved under constant human protection , and are thus unable to defend themselves very well . Wolves typically resort to attacking livestock when wild prey is depleted : in Eurasia , a large part of the diet of some wolf populations consists of livestock , while such incidences are rare in North America , where healthy populations of wild prey have been largely restored . The majority of losses occur during the summer grazing period , with untended livestock in remote pastures being the most vulnerable to wolf predation . The most frequently targeted livestock species are sheep ( Europe ) , domestic reindeer ( northern Scandinavia ) , goats ( India ) , horses ( Mongolia ) , cattle and turkeys ( North America ) . The number of animals killed in single attacks varies according to species : most attacks on cattle and horses result in one death , while turkeys , sheep and domestic reindeer may be killed in surplus . Wolves mainly attack livestock when the animals are grazing , though they occasionally break into fenced enclosures . In some cases , wolves do not need to physically attack livestock to negatively affect it : the stress livestock experiences in being vigilant for wolves may result in miscarriages , weight loss and a decrease in meat quality ."

The album was met with slightly more enthusiastic reviews than its predecessor but nevertheless , only managed to climb to number 152 on the Billboard Top LPs chart , while failing to reach the charts in the United Kingdom altogether . Musically , the album found the Byrds beginning to move away from their country rock sound \u2014 although at least half the album still bore a strong country influence \u2014 and instead , embrace a style indebted to 1950s rock ' n ' roll music . The Skip Battin and Kim Fowley penned song \" America 's Great National Pastime \" was taken from the album and released as a single in late November , but it failed to chart on either side of the Atlantic . Johnny Rogan has concluded that , ultimately , the rapidity with which the Byrds planned and recorded Farther Along resulted in an album that was just as flawed as Byrdmaniax and as a result , it failed to rehabilitate the band 's ailing commercial fortunes or increase their declining audience . The album 's title track , sung by White with the rest of the group harmonizing , would later become a poignant and prophetic epitaph for the guitarist when it was sung by ex @-@ Byrd Gram Parsons and the Eagles ' Bernie Leadon at White 's funeral in July 1973 ."

The underwater fireball took the form of a rapidly expanding hot gas bubble that pushed against the water , generating a supersonic hydraulic shock wave which crushed the hulls of nearby ships as it spread out . Eventually it slowed to the speed of sound in water , which is one mile per second ( 1600 m / s ) , five times faster than that of sound in air . On the surface , the shock wave was visible as the leading edge of a rapidly expanding ring of dark water , called the \" slick \" for its resemblance to an oil slick .
