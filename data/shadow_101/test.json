Bridges struggled to find a club ahead of the 2004 \u2013 05 campaign , and took up an offer to play for FK R\u012bga in Latvia . However , Bridges suffered a fractured foot just ten days after signing for the club , and failed to feature for the Latvian side .

However , he signed for Braintree Town on a short @-@ term contract shortly after training with Histon , making his debut for the club in a 2 \u2013 1 home victory against Slough Town a day after joining the club . In the following game , Bridges assisted two of Braintree 's goals in the club 's 4 \u2013 2 win away at Wealdstone , as well as making another assist a week later in a 5 \u2013 0 win against Billericay Town .

He left Histon at the end of the season , and subsequently earned himself a one @-@ year contract to re @-@ join his former employers , Cambridge United , following a successful trial at the club .

In North America it is found in the northeast , the Pacific Northwest and the southwestern United States . According to Ernst Both , it was Charles Horton Peck who first suggested in 1887 that the fungus was introduced to New York State on Pinus sylvestris . DNA studies show that the North American populations differ little genetically from European populations , supporting the idea that the fungus arrived to North America relatively recently as a result of human activity . Suillus luteus is found in coastal and mountainous pine forests and exhibits a tolerance of the northern latitudes . Southern Hemisphere locales where the slippery jack grow with plantation pines include South America , Africa , Australia , and New Zealand .

Rabies does not cause epidemics , but the infection was greatly feared because of its terrible symptoms , which include insanity , hydrophobia and death ."

Sometimes this introduction to pride life occurs earlier , however , particularly if other lionesses have given birth at about the same time . For instance , lionesses in a pride often synchronise their reproductive cycles so that they cooperate in the raising and suckling of the young ( once the cubs are past the initial stage of isolation with their mother ) , who suckle indiscriminately from any or all of the nursing females in the pride . In addition to greater protection , the synchronization of births also has an advantage in that the cubs end up being roughly the same size , and thus have an equal chance of survival . If one lioness gives birth to a litter of cubs a couple of months after another lioness , for instance , then the younger cubs , being much smaller than their older brethren , usually are dominated by larger cubs at mealtimes \u2013 consequently , death by starvation is more common among the younger cubs ."

The physical system itself need not be symmetric ; a jagged asteroid tumbling in space conserves angular momentum despite its asymmetry . Rather , the symmetry of the physical laws governing the system is responsible for the conservation law . As another example , if a physical experiment has the same outcome at any place and at any time , then its laws are symmetric under continuous translations in space and time ; by Noether 's theorem , these symmetries account for the conservation laws of linear momentum and energy within this system , respectively ."

    "text": "Immediately southeast of Mount Cayley lies Mount Fee , an extensively eroded volcano containing a north @-@ south trending ridge . It has an elevation of 2 @,@ 162 m ( 7 @,@ 093 ft ) and is one of the older volcanic features in the Mount Cayley volcanic field . Its volcanics are undated , but its large amount of dissection and evidence of glacial ice overriding the volcano indicates that it formed more than 75 @,@ 000 years ago before the Wisconsinan Glaciation . Therefore , volcanism at Mount Fee does not display evidence of interaction with glacial ice . The remaining products from Fee 's earliest volcanic activity is a minor portion of pyroclastic rock . This is evidence of explosive volcanism from Fee 's eruptive history , as well as its first volcanic event . The second volcanic event produced a sequence of lavas and breccias on the eastern flank of the main ridge . These volcanics were likely deposited when a sequence of lava flows and broken lava fragments erupted from a volcanic vent and moved down the flanks during the construction of a large volcano . Following extensive dissection , renewed volcanism produced a viscous series of lava flows forming its narrow , flat @-@ topped , steep @-@ sided northern limit and the northern end of the main ridge . The conduit for which these lava flows originated from was likely vertical in structure and intruded through older volcanics deposited during Fee 's earlier volcanic events . This volcanic event was also followed by a period of erosion , and likely one or more glacial periods . Extensive erosion following the last volcanic event at Mount Fee has created the rugged north @-@ south trending ridge that currently forms a prominent landmark ."

    "text": "Nonmetals have structures in which each atom usually forms ( 8 \u2212 N ) bonds with ( 8 \u2212 N ) nearest neighbours , where N is the number of valence electrons . Each atom is thereby able to complete its valence shell and attain a stable noble gas configuration . Exceptions to the ( 8 \u2212 N ) rule occur with hydrogen ( which only needs one bond to complete its valence shell ) , carbon , nitrogen and oxygen . Atoms of the latter three elements are sufficiently small such that they are able to form alternative ( more stable ) bonding structures , with fewer nearest neighbours . Thus , carbon is able to form its layered graphite structure , and nitrogen and oxygen are able to form diatomic molecules having triple and double bonds , respectively . The larger size of the remaining non @-@ noble nonmetals weakens their capacity to form multiple bonds and they instead form two or more single bonds to two or more different atoms . Sulfur , for example , forms an eight @-@ membered molecule in which the atoms are arranged in a ring , with each atom forming two single bonds to different atoms ."

The ancient Greeks had several gods and heroes who wore their hair long , including Zeus , Achilles , Apollo , and Poseidon . Greek soldiers are said to have worn their hair long in battle . Such warriors considered it a sign of aristocracy and are said to have combed it openly in order to show off . Also , in order to keep enemies from getting a hold of it in battle , they were known to cut the front short , but leave it long in the back , where it was more out of reach . A widely held alternative interpretation of the conventional belief is that they kept it long , and simply tied it back in a style known as a ponytail in order to keep it out of their enemies ' reach . The ponytail method allowed warriors , who often traveled to battle with a minimal amount of equipment in order to avoid excessively heavy loads over long marches , to keep their hair manageable with a small piece of string to hold their pony tail in place and a knife to cut the back to length with one simple slice . Around the sixth century , however , the Greek men shifted to shorter hairstyles , with the exception of the Spartans .

Shute was preparing to return to Massachusetts in 1727 when King George I died . This brought about a change of administration in London and a reshuffling of colonial governorships . The Massachusetts and New Hampshire governorships were given to William Burnet , then the governor of New York and New Jersey , and Shute was given a pension . Burnet 's brief administration was dominated by an extended attempt by the governor to secure an annual salary . The sudden death of Burnet in 1729 again opened the Massachusetts and New Hampshire seats . Shute was apparently considered again for the post , but demurred , implicitly offering his support instead to Jonathan Belcher , who was actively seeking the post ."

The book was financed with help from his fellow cadets at West Point , many of whom donated 75 cents to the cause , raising a total of $ 170 . They may have been expecting verses similar to the satirical ones that Poe had been writing about commanding officers . It was printed by Elam Bliss of New York , labeled as \" Second Edition , \" and including a page saying , \" To the U.S. Corps of Cadets this volume is respectfully dedicated \" . The book once again reprinted the long poems \" Tamerlane \" and \" Al Aaraaf \" but also six previously unpublished poems , including early versions of \" To Helen \" , \" Israfel \" , and \" The City in the Sea \" . He returned to Baltimore to his aunt , brother , and cousin in March 1831 .

Polar bears can breed with brown bears to produce fertile grizzly \u2013 polar bear hybrids , rather than indicating that they have only recently diverged , the new evidence suggests more frequent mating has continued over a longer period of time , and thus the two bears remain genetically similar .

    "text": "As with the extinctions that occurred on other land masses during the late Pleistocene and Holocene ( known as the Quaternary extinction event ) , the disappearance of Madagascar 's megafauna is tightly linked with the arrival of humans , with nearly all extinctions dating to around the same time of the earliest evidence of human activity on the island or significantly later . The exact date of human arrival is unknown , although a radius ( arm bone ) of a Palaeopropithecus ingens with distinct cut marks from the removal of flesh with sharp objects dates to approximately 2325 \u00b1 43 BP ( 2366 \u2013 2315 cal yr BP ) . Based on this evidence from Taolambiby in the southwest interior , as well as other dates for human @-@ modified dwarf hippo bones and introduced plant pollen from other parts of the island , the arrival of humans is conservatively estimated at approximately 350 cal yr BCE . Measurements of stratigraphic charcoal and the appearance of exotic plant pollen dated from Holocene core samples confirm these approximated dates for human arrival in the southwestern corner of the island and further suggest that the central and northern parts of the island did not experience significant human impact until 700 to 1 @,@ 500 years later . The humid forests of the lower interior of the island were the last to be settled ( as shown by the presence of charcoal particles ) , possibly due to the prevalence of human diseases , such as plague , malaria , and dysentery . The entire island was not fully colonized by humans until the beginning of the second millennium CE ."

It also adversely affects the function of Kupffer cells , which are specialized macrophage cells that assist in preventing bacteria from entering the biliary system . Finally , increased biliary pressure decreases production of IgA immunoglobulins in the bile .

As the ITO never became ratified , GATT became the de facto framework for later multilateral trade negotiations . Members emphasized trade reprocity as an approach to lowering barriers in pursuit of mutual gains .

GATT was centered on two precepts : trade relations needed to be equitable and nondiscriminatory , and subsidizing non @-@ agricultural exports needed to be prohibited . As such , the agreement 's most favored nation clause prohibited members from offering preferential tariff rates to any nation that it would not otherwise offer to fellow GATT members .

The agreement provided governments with a transparent structure for managing trade relations and avoiding protectionist pressures .

The agreement 's initial round achieved only limited success in reducing tariffs . While the U.S. reduced its tariffs by one third , other signatories offered much smaller trade concessions ."

Mup proteins have been shown to promote puberty and accelerate the estrus cycle in female mice , inducing the Vandenbergh and Whitten effects . However , in both cases the Mups had to be presented to the female dissolved in male urine , indicating that the protein requires some urinary context to function . In 2007 Mups normally found in male mouse urine were made in transgenic bacteria , and therefore created devoid of the chemicals they normally bind . These Mups were shown to be sufficient to promote aggressive behaviour in males , even in the absence of urine . In addition , Mups made in bacteria were found to activate olfactory sensory neurons in the vomeronasal organ ( VNO ) , a subsystem of the nose known to detect pheromones via specific sensory receptors , of mice and rats .

The property records and revenue generated from the sale or rent of confiscated property were all recorded and deposited with the Ministry of Financial Affairs to provide for the possible return of property to owners . In addition , the law provided that those whose property had been confiscated to sue for return of the property ( and payment for any damages which occurred ) . However , the law required property owners to sue and be present themselves ( not allowing the power of attorney ) , an impossibility when property owners had been killed or deported . In addition , the defendant in any case would be the state which made the chances of success in any lawsuit extremely unlikely .

In the early 1900s , stallions of Thoroughbred and Arabian ancestry were also turned out onto the range . However , the breeding of the Pryor Mountain herd was in dispute for many years . One horseman hired by the federal government during the 1920s to round up excess feral horses on the range stated , \" The whole country around was overrun with thousands of homesteaders ' horses ... but this little band ... were , and are , the genuine Spanish horses and there were about 70 head .

Since no genetic variants were observed not also seen in domestic horse breeds , in 2010 Cothran also concluded the horses were not a unique species which had survived in North America from prehistoric times . Rather , they were linear descendants of the Spanish Barb , with some evidence of genetic similarity to light racing and riding breeds .

She did acknowledge Todd 's capability of loving his children , which he expressed by doing \" crazy and illegal things to prove it \" , but felt that much of the difficulty he experiences is brought on by himself and that he is incapable of learning from his mistakes even when they hurt the people he loves . She said Todd is in need of \" intensive therapy \" , which will never work because he refuses to change . For example , as portrayed by St. John in 2006 , he fights for the custody of his son , Sam , but he is motivated by anger that he has been lied to and revenge more than by a desire to recover his child ."

Further , state newspapers noted a lack of eloquence by the governor , and this provided additional fodder for Blackburn 's critics . Having announced at the beginning of his term that he would seek no further political office , Blackburn nonetheless attempted to defend his record in a speech at the 1883 Democratic nominating convention , but boos and shouts for him to sit down almost drowned out the address .

At this , the clamor from the crowd became deafening , and Blackburn was forced to end his address and take his seat ."

The struggle over whether the government would be dominated by the emperor or by the parliament was carried over into debates from 1826 to 1831 on the establishment of the governmental and political structure . Unable to deal with the problems in both Brazil and Portugal simultaneously , the Emperor abdicated on behalf of his son , Pedro II , on 7 April 1831 and immediately sailed for Europe to restore his daughter to her throne ."

The Chief decides to activate this Halo ; the ringworld would eliminate the Flood infestation on the Ark while sparing the galaxy at large from destruction . To activate the ring , the Chief rescues Cortana , who has the Activation Index of the destroyed Halo , from High Charity and destroys the city . Arriving on the new Halo , Cortana warns that Gravemind is trying to rebuild itself on the ring . The Chief , Arbiter , and Johnson travel to Halo 's control room to activate the ring . Guilty Spark explains that because the ring is not yet complete , a premature activation will destroy it and the Ark .

The yellow @-@ green ytterbium ( II ) ion is a very strong reducing agent and decomposes water , releasing hydrogen gas , and thus only the colorless ytterbium ( III ) ion occurs in aqueous solution .

However , they maintained relations with Pompey , and after his defeat and death , a force under Pacorus I assisted the Pompeian general Q. Caecilius Bassus , who was besieged at Apamea Valley by Caesarian forces . With the civil war over , Julius Caesar prepared a campaign against Parthia , but his assassination averted the war . The Parthians supported Brutus and Cassius during the ensuing Liberators ' civil war and sent a contingent to fight on their side at the Battle of Philippi in 42 BC . After the Liberators ' defeat , the Parthians invaded Roman territory in 40 BC in conjunction with the Roman Quintus Labienus , a former supporter of Brutus and Cassius . They swiftly overran the Roman province of Syria and advanced into Judaea , overthrowing the Roman client Hyrcanus II and installing his nephew Antigonus . For a moment , the whole of the Roman East seemed lost to the Parthians or about to fall into their hands . However , the conclusion of the second Roman civil war soon revived Roman strength in Asia . Mark Antony had sent Ventidius to oppose Labienus , who had invaded Anatolia . Soon Labienus was driven back to Syria by Roman forces , and , although reinforced by the Parthians , was defeated , taken prisoner , and killed . After suffering a further defeat near the Syrian Gates , the Parthians withdrew from Syria . They returned in 38 BC but were decisively defeated by Ventidius , and Pacorus was killed . In Judaea , Antigonus was ousted with Roman help by Herod in 37 BC . With Roman control of Syria and Judaea restored , Mark Antony led a huge army into Atropatene , but his siege train and its escort were isolated and wiped out , while his Armenian allies deserted . Failing to make progress against Parthian positions , the Romans withdrew with heavy casualties . Antony was again in Armenia in 33 BC to join with the Median king against Octavian and the Parthians .

At that time , Harrison had never worked in Britain : although he had qualified there , he had practised in Greece and Palestine . Indeed , the college seems to have been his only project in the country , and remains his best known work , along with his later University of Ghana . Harrison was not given any restrictions or limitations on style ; Nuffield agreed to Harrison 's appointment , but was not consulted on the architectural style of the college before Harrison started work . When Nuffield 's donation was announced , it was reported that the \" general idea \" was that the college buildings should be sited behind gardens , similar to the memorial gardens at Christ Church , Oxford , so that those entering Oxford from the west would be faced with a \" beautiful vista of well @-@ planned gardens seen through railings \" ; this idea did not form part of Harrison 's designs ."

That is , the bulky springs and dampers are mounted in the space between the wheels and the bodywork , where they interfere with the airflow and increase unwanted aerodynamic drag . Tauranac persisted with this apparently conservative approach based on wind tunnel tests he had carried out in the early 1960s , which indicated that a more complicated inboard design , with the springs and dampers concealed under the bodywork , would provide only a 2 % improvement in drag .

    "text": "According to the Egyptologists Jean Sainte Fare Garnot and Herman te Velde , the name of \" Peribsen \" accords religious meaning , even before association with a deity . The name \" Peribsen \" literally means \" He who comes forth by their will \" or \" His heart and will comes forth for them . \" The Egyptian syllable sn means \" them , their , those \" , revealing a clear plural writing . Te Velde and Garnot are convinced that Peribsen used the heraldic Seth animal as a serekh patron , but also linked his name to Horus . If true , it would prove that Peribsen worshipped Horus and Seth on an equal footing during his lifetime . An ostentatious plural meaning with religious ambiguity was not uncommon for pharaohs ' names in the early Egyptian dynasties . Peribsen may have been perceived as a living incarnation of both Horus and Seth in equal measure , just like his predecessors on the throne . Therefore , Peribsen 's name may actually show no break in the sacred tradition ; he added the power of Seth to Horus . As further examples , the titles of early dynastic queens used plural patron deities , such as \" she who is allowed to see Horus and Seth \" and \" she who carries Horus and Seth \" . Similarly , the unusual serekh of king Khasekhemwy , the last ruler of the Second dynasty , shows the deities Horus and Seth together atop the serekh . Horus wears the White Crown of Upper Egypt and Seth wears the Red Crown of Lower Egypt . Both gods are depicted facing each other in a kissing gesture . This special name was meant to illustrate the dual incarnation of the king as the representative of Horus and Seth , with power over all Egypt . Khasekhemwy 's name can be interpreted as an advanced form of Peribsen 's serekh name ."

They conclude that factors in addition to the strength of Bismarck 's Realpolitik led a collection of early modern polities to reorganize political , economic , military , and diplomatic relationships in the 19th century . Reaction to Danish and French nationalism provided foci for expressions of German unity . Military successes \u2014 especially those of Prussia \u2014 in three regional wars generated enthusiasm and pride that politicians could harness to promote unification . This experience echoed the memory of mutual accomplishment in the Napoleonic Wars , particularly in the War of Liberation of 1813 \u2013 14 .

The first appointee , Teodoro de Croix , served as governor and commander in chief of the area from 1776 until 1783 . As de Croix prepared to take office , his predecessor , Baron of Ripperd\u00e0 , wrote a detailed report , dated April 27 , 1777 , of the settlements in Texas . One @-@ third of the report detailed the village of Bucareli , which he labeled as \" ' of the greatest importance as a means of acquiring reports of a coast as extensive as it is uninhabited . ' \" The Bucareli settlers regularly performed coastal explorations and developed a friendship with the Bidai tribe , who reported any signs of foreigners along the coast . In the summer of 1777 , Gil Ybarbo discovered that a group of Englishmen had come from the sea and stayed long enough to plant a crop near the Neches River .

Richard , 44 years old when they met , had earlier resolved to remain a bachelor to better serve the public . Their mutual affection was powerful , but the couple 's happiness was diminished by the death of his mother the following year . Sophia Jane Goulden chastised her daughter for \" throwing herself \" at Richard and urged her without success to exhibit more aloofness . Emmeline suggested to Richard that they avoid the legal formalities of marriage by entering into a free union ; he objected on the grounds that she would be excluded from political life as an unmarried woman . He noted that his colleague Elizabeth Wolstenholme Elmy had faced social condemnation before she formalised her marriage to Ben Elmy . Emmeline Goulden agreed , and they were wed in St Luke 's Church , Pendleton on 18 December 1879 ."

    "text": "Loss of habitat is the single greatest threat to any species . If an island on which an endemic organism lives becomes uninhabitable for some reason , the species will become extinct . Any type of habitat surrounded by a different habitat is in a similar situation to an island . If a forest is divided into parts by logging , with strips of cleared land separating woodland blocks , and the distances between the remaining fragments exceeds the distance an individual animal is able to travel , that species becomes especially vulnerable . Small populations generally lack genetic diversity and may be threatened by increased predation , increased competition , disease and unexpected catastrophe . At the edge of each forest fragment , increased light encourages secondary growth of fast @-@ growing species and old growth trees are more vulnerable to logging as access is improved . The birds that nest in their crevices , the epiphytes that hang from their branches and the invertebrates in the leaf litter are all adversely affected and biodiversity is reduced . Habitat fragmentation can be ameliorated to some extent by the provision of wildlife corridors connecting the fragments . These can be a river , ditch , strip of trees , hedgerow or even an underpass to a highway . Without the corridors , seeds cannot disperse and animals , especially small ones , cannot travel through the hostile territory , putting populations at greater risk of local extinction ."

He believed that he had revealed three large figures , a warrior , a hooded goddess , and a sun god , asserting them to be likely 3000 years old , and then began excavation to remove the turf and reveal the figures . Lethbridge sought much publicity for his discovery , reporting on it to The Times and being interviewed by the London Evening News .

If one began a numerical sequence at 0 , then included 3 , 6 , 12 , 24 , 48 , etc . , doubling each time , and added four to each number and divided by 10 , this produced a remarkably close approximation to the radii of the orbits of the known planets as measured in astronomical units .

Hypotheses to explain the evolution of biomineralization include physiological adaptation to changing chemistry of the oceans , defense against predators and the opportunity to grow larger . The functions of biomineralization in SSFs vary : some SSFs are not yet understood ; some are components of armor ; and some are skeletons . A skeleton is any fairly rigid structure of an animal , irrespective of whether it has joints and irrespective of whether it is biomineralized . Although some SSFs may not be skeletons , SSFs are biomineralized by definition , being shelly . Skeletons provide a wide range of possible advantages , including : protection , support , attachment to a surface , a platform or set of levers for muscles to act on , traction when moving on a surface , food handling , provision of filtration chambers and storage of essential substances ."

Churches for whites existed from the inauguration of the colonies , but slaves were barred from worshipping before 1807 as colonists feared education and Christianisation would lead slaves to question their status and lead to dissatisfaction . Indeed , a Wesleyan missionary who arrived in 1805 wanting to set up a church for slaves was immediately repatriated by order of the governor . The London Missionary Society ( LMS ) entered Guyana shortly after the end of the slave trade at the behest of a plantation owner who believed that slaves ought to have access to religious teachings . Hermanus Post , a naturalised Englishman of Dutch descent , advocated teaching of religion and literacy . The idea , considered radical at the time , was supported by some who may have thought religion was to be offered as a consolation in place of emancipation . The colonial administration was hostile to the idea . It was written in the official journal , Royal Gazette , in 1808 : \" It is dangerous to make slaves Christians , without giving them their liberty . \" Others strongly opposed . Other plantation owners , who felt that teaching slaves anything other than their duties to their masters would lead to \" anarchy , chaos and discontent \" and precipitate the destruction of the colony .

This is from a letter sent to Henry Zd\u00edk , the Bishop of Olmuetz by the pope . However , a letter sent by the pope on the next day , 12 October 1147 , to Eberhard , the Archbishop of Salzburg , named Troyes as the location for the council . It is likely that Troyes , however , was a scribal error , as a further letter of Eugene 's , to Suger , Abbot of St Denis , dated 6 October 1147 , named Trier as the location also , thus confirming the location given in the letter of 11 October ."

However , soon after leaving the embassy , Chen feared that Chinese authorities would renege on their promises or take punitive actions against his family members . While in the hospital , Chinese security personnel barred U.S. diplomatic staff from meeting with him . Rumors emerged that Chinese officials had coerced Chen into leaving the embassy by threatening his family . U.S. negotiators stated that while in the embassy , Chen had been told by Chinese officials that if he sought asylum in the United States , his wife and daughter would likely remain under house arrest in Shandong . However , they maintained that they had not heard of the threats from local officials that his family would be beaten , and that they had not communicated such a message to Chen . On 3 May , Chen clarified to the BBC that he had become aware of the threats against his family after leaving the embassy , and at that point changed his mind about wishing to stay in China ."

    "text": "The English physician Edward Jenner demonstrated the effectiveness of cowpox to protect humans from smallpox in 1796 , after which various attempts were made to eliminate smallpox on a regional scale . The introduction of the vaccine to the New World took place in Trinity , Newfoundland in 1800 by Dr. John Clinch , boyhood friend and medical colleague of Jenner . As early as 1803 , the Spanish Crown organized the Balmis expedition to transport the vaccine to the Spanish colonies in the Americas and the Philippines , and establish mass vaccination programs there . The U.S. Congress passed the Vaccine Act of 1813 to ensure that safe smallpox vaccine would be available to the American public . By about 1817 , a very solid state vaccination program existed in the Dutch East Indies . In British India a program was launched to propagate smallpox vaccination , through Indian vaccinators , under the supervision of European officials . Nevertheless , British vaccination efforts in India , and in Burma in particular , were hampered by stubborn indigenous preference for inoculation and distrust of vaccination , despite tough legislation , improvements in the local efficacy of the vaccine and vaccine preservative , and education efforts . By 1832 , the federal government of the United States established a smallpox vaccination program for Native Americans . In 1842 , the United Kingdom banned inoculation , later progressing to mandatory vaccination . The British government introduced compulsory smallpox vaccination by an Act of Parliament in 1853 . In the United States , from 1843 to 1855 first Massachusetts , and then other states required smallpox vaccination . Although some disliked these measures , coordinated efforts against smallpox went on , and the disease continued to diminish in the wealthy countries . By 1897 , smallpox had largely been eliminated from the United States . In Northern Europe a number of countries had eliminated smallpox by 1900 , and by 1914 , the incidence in most industrialized countries had decreased to comparatively low levels . Vaccination continued in industrialized countries , until the mid to late 1970s as protection against reintroduction . Australia and New Zealand are two notable exceptions ; neither experienced endemic smallpox and never vaccinated widely , relying instead on protection by distance and strict quarantines ."

Learning from this experience , Tudor then built a functioning ice depot in Havana and , despite the U.S. trade embargo declared in 1807 , was trading successfully again by 1810 . He was unable to acquire exclusive legal rights to import ice into Cuba , but was nonetheless able to maintain an effective monopoly through his control of the ice houses . The 1812 war briefly disrupted trade , but over subsequent years Tudor began to export fruit back from Havana to the mainland on the return journey , kept fresh with part of the unsold ice cargo .
