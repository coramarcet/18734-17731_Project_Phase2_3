Through the work of leading theoretical physicists , a new theory of electromagnetism was developed using quantum mechanics . This final modification to electromagnetic theory ultimately led to quantum electrodynamics ( or QED ) , which fully describes all electromagnetic phenomena as being mediated by wave \u2013 particles known as photons . In QED , photons are the fundamental exchange particle , which described all interactions relating to electromagnetism including the electromagnetic force ."

Used cnidocytes have to be replaced , which takes about 48 hours .

This combination prevents them from firing at distant or non @-@ living objects . Groups of cnidocytes are usually connected by nerves and , if one fires , the rest of the group requires a weaker minimum stimulus than the cells that fire first ."

Religious laws and expectations , or \" personal laws \" enumerated by each specific religion , often conflict with the Indian Constitution , eliminating rights and powers women should legally have . Despite these crossovers in legality , the Indian government does not interfere with religion and the personal laws they hold . Religions , like Hinduism , call for women to be faithful servants to God and their husbands . They have a term called pativrata that describes a wife who has accepted service and devotion to her husband and his family as her ultimate religion and duty . Indian society is largely composed of hierarchical systems within families and communities . These hierarchies can be broken down into age , sex , ordinal position , kinship relationships ( within families ) , and caste , lineage , wealth , occupations , and relationship to ruling power ( within the community ) . When hierarchies emerge within the family based on social convention and economic need , girls in poorer families suffer twice the impact of vulnerability and stability . From birth , girls are automatically entitled to less ; from playtime , to food , to education , girls can expect to always be entitled to less than their brothers . Girls also have less access to their family 's income and assets , which is exacerbated among poor , rural Indian families . From the start , it is understood that females will be burdened with strenuous work and exhausting responsibilities for the rest of their lives , always with little to no compensation or recognition ."

The end must occur , by the rules of the games after a finite number of moves ( remembering the 50 move drawing rule ) . Each of these variations ends in win , loss or draw . By working backward from the end one can determine whether there is a forced win , the position is a draw or is lost . It is easy to show , however , even with the high computing speed available in electronic calculators this computation is impractical . In typical chess positions there will be of the order of 30 legal moves . The number holds fairly constant until the game is nearly finished as shown ... by De Groot , who averaged the number of legal moves in a large number of master games . Thus a move for White and then one for Black gives about 103 possibilities . A typical game lasts about 40 moves to resignation of one party . This is conservative for our calculation since the machine would calculate out to checkmate , not resignation . However , even at this figure there will be 10120 variations to be calculated from the initial position . A machine operating at the rate of one variation per microsecond would require over 1090 years to calculate the first move !"

The election , like many other Scottish episcopal elections of the period , was done in the presence of the king , William the Lion , at Perth , near Scone , the chief residence of Scotland 's kings . The election was probably done by compromissarii , meaning that the general chapter of the bishopric of Glasgow had selected a small group to which they delegated the power of election . Pope Alexander III was later told that Jocelin was elected by the dean and chapter of the see . The Chronicle of Melrose states that he was elected \" by demand of the clergy , and of the people ; and with the consent of the king himself \" , perhaps indicating that the decision had already been made by the Glasgow clergy before the formal election at Perth . The election was certainly an achievement . Cistercian bishops were rare in Great Britain , and Jocelin was only the second Cistercian to ascend a Scottish bishopric . Jocelin was required to go to France to obtain permission from the General Chapter of the Cistercian order at C\u00eeteaux to resign the abbacy . Pope Alexander III had already sanctioned his consecration , and gave permission for the consecration to occur without forcing Jocelin to travel to Rome .

Katipo can catch insects much larger than themselves . These larger insects often become entangled in the web and in the ensuing struggle , the web 's ground anchor line breaks . Due to the silk 's elasticity , this causes the prey to become suspended a few centimetres off the ground . The katipo then moves to the prey , turns so that the spinnerets are facing the insect and spins silk over it . Like most theridiids , the tarsi of the hind legs have a row of strong curved bristles which are arranged as a comb . The katipo uses these to scoop sticky silk from her spinnerets and throws it over the insect with a series of rapid movements . After the insect is firmly immobilised , she bites it several times , usually at the joints , before spinning more silk to strengthen the web , and then administering a last long bite which ultimately kills the insect . The spider then moves the prey up into the web until it is ready to eat . If food is readily available then it is common to see five or six insects hanging in the web waiting to be ingested . The male 's hunting behaviour is similar to the female 's , although may not be as vigorous due to its smaller size ."

Each microgame requires that the player position the Wii Remote in a specific way , such as holding it vertically , or placing the bottom end of the device against the nose . The player is required to use the Nunchuk attachment for the Wii Remote in certain microgames . Before each microgame begins , the required position for the Wii Remote is shown to the player , to allow them time to position the device . The game is broken up into stages , each represented by a WarioWare character and loosely connected by a story , with the microgames divided among the stages . After the player completes a stage 's microgames , they advance to the boss stage , which is a microgame that is longer and more complex than the others . After the player completes all of the single @-@ player stages , the game unlocks a multiplayer mode , in which only one Wii Remote is used and shared by up to 12 players .

    "text": "The name \" alternative rock \" essentially serves as an umbrella term for underground music that has emerged in the wake of punk rock since the mid @-@ 1980s .

Alternative bands during the 1980s generally played in small clubs , recorded for indie labels , and spread their popularity through word of mouth . As such , there is no set musical style for alternative rock as a whole , although The New York Times in 1989 asserted that the genre is \" guitar music first of all , with guitars that blast out power chords , pick out chiming riffs , buzz with fuzztone and squeal in feedback . \" Sounds range from the gloomy soundscapes of gothic rock to the jangling guitars of indie pop to the dirty guitars of grunge to the 1960s / 1970s revivalism of Britpop . More often than in other rock @-@ styles since the mainstreaming of rock music during the 1970s , alternative rock lyrics tend to address topics of social concern , such as drug use , depression , suicide , and environmentalism .

It challenges several long @-@ standing ideas about this period : that the \" Hampton @-@ Tuskegee system \" and its adherents stunted the progress of African Americans , that the Hampton Institute ideology was opposed to that of historically black and historically white colleges , and that the positions of W.

Engs 's Armstrong , in \" paternal ... arrogance \" believed that he and others of higher status could best determine how to improve the lots of those suppressed by \" lack of opportunity and discrimination \" , such as African Americans and American Indians . This intuition , of knowing \" what was best for the freedmen \" , was influenced by his experience in missionary work , where his parents treated the indigenous Hawaiians as misbehaving children with behavior to be corrected . The biography distills Armstrong 's philosophy , demeanor , and understanding of African Americans from his experiences as a missionary , student of Williams College , and leader in the American Civil War .

Only a few years later , in 1983 , in his study of Hazlitt as critic , David Bromwich considers at length some issues involving Characters of Shakespear 's Plays . Against some allegations to the contrary in earlier studies of Hazlitt , Bromwich concludes that Hazlitt borrowed little from Coleridge , and he presents several contrasts in their critical views , particularly about Shakespeare , as evidence . In extended discussions of Hazlitt 's critical treatment of the character of Iago in Othello , of Shylock in The Merchant of Venice , of Caliban in The Tempest , of Hamlet , and , at great length , of Coriolanus , he uses the contrast between Coleridge 's criticism and Hazlitt 's to highlight the essential originality of Hazlitt 's critical stance , and he observes that Hazlitt 's views frequently provide a bracing alternative to Coleridge 's . He also delves into the issue of Hazlitt 's influence on Keats partly by means of Characters , particularly the chapter on King Lear , and he finds in Hazlitt 's comments on Lear interesting contrasts and similarities with the critical views of Wordsworth and Shelley . Building upon the arguments advanced by Kinnaird , Bromwich further challenges the \" reductive \" notion that Characters was simply a work of \" character \" criticism ."

Arkham City has a virtual footprint five times larger than that of Arkham Asylum , and the navigational aspects were improved to offer the player \" the freedom and exhilaration of gliding down alleyways and soaring above the skyline \" . Though the concepts were compared to an open world game , Hill notes that such freeform nature would not be appropriate for a Batman game because it would inhibit the atmosphere they wanted to create , and that Arkham City was designed to challenge the player to think like Batman to survive . To counterbalance the larger game world , the developers also sought to include more challenges and side missions while keeping the player alert as to the primary mission , such that the players constantly are aware of \" extreme pressure of the challenges that they face \" . The Riddler Trophies were designed towards the end of the game 's development and were incorporated into every area of the map without overpopulating it , resulting in 440 trophies . Rocksteady aimed to make the player think creatively when collecting trophies by requiring the use of gadgets to solve puzzles , rather than placing the trophies in obscure areas of the map as mere collection items ."

After her birth , she was initially taken into the household of Leigh Hunt as the child of a cousin . A few months later the Shelleys and Claire took the baby back as an \" adopted \" child . Claire bonded with her baby daughter and wrote in her journal with delight about her close , physical connection with little Allegra , but she was also dealing with emotional and financial pressures from the Shelleys that made it difficult for her to keep the baby with her . The Shelleys were fond of Allegra , but Mary Shelley feared that neighbours would believe Percy Bysshe Shelley fathered her as the truth about her relationship to Claire leaked out . William Godwin , Mary 's father and Claire 's stepfather , had immediately leaped to that conclusion when he learned of Allegra 's birth . In an October 1817 letter to Percy Bysshe Shelley , Mary Shelley remarked that their toddler son William disliked Allegra , but was fond of his baby sister Clara . She saw her son 's reaction to Allegra , who was no blood relation to him , as \" an argument in favor of those who advocate instinctive natural affection . The Shelleys were constantly in debt . Mary Shelley wanted the baby to be sent to Byron and wanted her difficult and temperamental stepsister , who had too close a relationship with her husband , to leave her house ."

Lynch also infused subtle rumblings throughout portions of the film that reviewers noted added unsettling and creepy effects . Hageman also identifies \" perpetual and uncanny ambient sound \" , and places a particular emphasis on the scene where the man collapses behind Winkies as normal sound is drowned out by a buzzing roar , noting that the noise \" creates a dissonance and suspense that draws in the spectator as detective to place the sound and reestablish order \" . Mulholland Drive 's ending with the woman at Club Silencio whispering is an example of Lynch 's aural deception and surreality , according to Ruth Perlmutter , who writes , \" The acting , the dreams , the search for identity , the fears and terrors of the undefined self are over when the film is over , and therefore , there is only silence and enigma . \""

    "text": "Another application of widest paths arises in the Ford \u2013 Fulkerson algorithm for the maximum flow problem . Repeatedly augmenting a flow along a maximum capacity path in the residual network of the flow leads to a small bound , O ( m log U ) , on the number of augmentations needed to find a maximum flow ; here , the edge capacities are assumed to be integers that are at most U. However , this analysis does not depend on finding a path that has the exact maximum of capacity ; any path whose capacity is within a constant factor of the maximum suffices . Combining this approximation idea with the shortest path augmentation method of the Edmonds \u2013 Karp algorithm leads to a maximum flow algorithm with running time O ( mn log U ) ."

    "text": "One of the main aspects of the series that critics point out , either positively or negatively , is that the series \" never strays from its classic roots . \" Unlike other modern , complex RPGs , Dragon Quest on the DS retains the simple gameplay from the first game that many critics find refreshing and nostalgic . Points of contention are its battle system , comparatively simplistic storylines , general lack of character development , simplistic primitive @-@ looking graphics ( in earlier titles ) , and the overall difficulty of the game . These arguments are countered by noting its strength in episodic storytelling with the various non @-@ player characters the party meets . The stories avoid melodrama and feature relatively more simplistic characters than Final Fantasy 's Squall Leonhart or Tidus , a source of contention . There are exceptions , however , such as Dragon Quest V , which has been praised for its unique , emotional storytelling . Battles are also simple and finish quickly . As for difficulty , Yuji Horii is noted as a gambler . The lack of save points and the general difficulty of the battles were included with the intention of adding a sense of tension . Because of this added difficulty , the punishment for the party 's death was toned down compared to other games by simply going back to where you had last saved , with half of your gold on hand . When asked about criticism of Dragon Quest games , Horii says he does not mind , it means the critics played the game and he would rather know their concerns than remain ignorant ."

As a kit , Stormkit falls into the river after he sneaks out of camp and attempts to chase ThunderClan medicine cat Goosefeather away from Sunningrocks , a part of RiverClan territory ( at the time ) . This leads him to break his jaw on a rock . Rainflower , Stormkit 's mother , rejects Stormkit due to his disfigured appearance and demands that RiverClan leader Hailstar perform a renaming ceremony to rename Stormkit to Crookedkit . Feeling rejected , Crookedkit is visited in a dream by Mapleshade , a Dark Forest cat who allows Crookedkit to believe that she is from StarClan . She tells him that she can give him anything he wants as long as he is faithful to his Clan and puts all other things aside . Crookedkit quickly accepts this promise , believing it not to be a difficult promise , as he was already loyal to his Clan , and believes that Mapleshade can help him become leader . Mapleshade then uses Crookedkit 's promise to seemingly bring about the deaths of Crookedkit 's loved ones . When Crookedjaw is chasing away a dog , the dog knocks his mother , Rainflower , into a river , and she hits her head on rocks . Mapleshade urges Crookedjaw to focus on the dog instead of bringing his mother to the medicine cat , and she dies . Crookedjaw then becomes deputy upon his father Shellheart 's retirement ; shortly after , Shellheart dies of a lump in his stomach . Not long after , Hailstar loses his last life while fighting rats in a barn : although Mapleshade urges him to not protect Hailstar so he can become leader , Crookedjaw ignores her , having discovered that she is actually from the Dark Forest . Nonetheless , Hailstar is killed . Despite his insistence that she stay away from him , Mapleshade continues to haunt Crookedstar : his mate , Willowbreeze , dies of a respiratory infection days after giving birth to his three kits , and two of the kits die as well . When Crookedstar confronts Mapleshade , she reveals that she had once been the mate of Crookedstar 's great @-@ grandfather . Mapleshade had been a ThunderClan cat , while her mate had been from RiverClan : Mapleshade is rejected by her Clan for taking a forbidden mate , then loses the kits in the river when she attempts to bring them to RiverClan .

When Crookedstar finally reveals his promise and his belief that it caused the deaths of his loved ones , to his medicine cat Brambleberry , she argues that the deaths were not in fact Mapleshade 's fault . Following the conclusion of the novel , Oakheart is killed , then in the manga feature , Silverstream , Crookedstar 's only remaining kit , dies after giving birth to Graystripe of ThunderClan 's kits . Mapleshade asserts that these deaths were her doing as well , but Crookedstar tells Mapleshade that she has failed to punish him , as his loved ones live on in StarClan , while she has no one .

    "text": "DNA contains the genetic information that allows all modern living things to function , grow and reproduce . However , it is unclear how long in the 4 @-@ billion @-@ year history of life DNA has performed this function , as it has been proposed that the earliest forms of life may have used RNA as their genetic material . RNA may have acted as the central part of early cell metabolism as it can both transmit genetic information and carry out catalysis as part of ribozymes . This ancient RNA world where nucleic acid would have been used for both catalysis and genetics may have influenced the evolution of the current genetic code based on four nucleotide bases . This would occur , since the number of different bases in such an organism is a trade @-@ off between a small number of bases increasing replication accuracy and a large number of bases increasing the catalytic efficiency of ribozymes . However , there is no direct evidence of ancient genetic systems , as recovery of DNA from most fossils is impossible because DNA survives in the environment for less than one million years , and slowly degrades into short fragments in solution . Claims for older DNA have been made , most notably a report of the isolation of a viable bacterium from a salt crystal 250 million years old , but these claims are controversial ."

Officials perceived that route would carry all California bound traffic directly to Nevada while passing through very few communities in Utah . Utah instead favored the Victory Highway ( modern Interstate 80 west of Salt Lake ) and the Arrowhead Trail ( modern Interstate 15 ) . By favoring these routes Utah could force travelers destined for southern California to use a different route than those destined for northern California , with both of these traversing through more cities in Utah than the Lincoln Highway . The Arrowhead trail was especially beneficial to Utah as it passed through many communities in the state , but only Las Vegas in Nevada ."

Of these related species , it is most closely related to S. porcinus . Genomic restriction fragment analysis of diverse host and geographical panels of S. iniae isolates has shown common profiles between virulent fish and human strains , though multiple pulsed field gel electrophoresis patterns have been identified among human isolates ."

    "text": "Individual mysids are either male or female , and fertilisation is external . The gonads are in the thorax and are tubular in shape . Males have two gonopores in the eighth thoracic segment and a pair of long penises . The female gonopores are in the sixth thoracic segment and the oostegites are attached to the first to seventh pereopods to form a brood pouch . Mating usually takes place at night and lasts only a few minutes . During the process , the male inserts his penises into the marsupium and releases sperm . This stimulates the female and the eggs are usually released into the marsupium within an hour . Here they are fertilised and retained , development of the embryos in the brood pouch being direct with the young hatching from the eggs as miniature adults . The size of a mysid brood generally correlates with body length and environmental factors such as density and food availability . The age at which mysids reach sexual maturity depends on water temperature and food availability . For the species Mysidopsis bahia , this is normally at 12 to 20 days . The young are released soon afterwards , and although their numbers are usually low , the short reproductive cycle of mysid adults means a new brood can be produced every four to seven days ."

Whether the poems are valuable as translations continues to be a source of controversy . Hugh Kenner contends that Cathay should be read primarily as a work about World War I , not as an attempt at accurately translating ancient Eastern poems . The real achievement of the book , Kenner argues , is in how it combines meditations on violence and friendship with an effort to \" rethink the nature of an English poem \" . These ostensible translations of ancient Eastern texts , Kenner argues , are actually experiments in English poetics and compelling elegies for a warring West .

Because of its elevation and sheltered environment , Gangtok enjoys a mild , temperate climate all year round . Like most Himalayan towns , Gangtok has five seasons : summer , monsoons , autumn , winter and spring . Temperatures range from an average maximum of 22 \u00b0 C ( 72 \u00b0 F ) in summer to an average minimum of 4 \u00b0 C ( 39 \u00b0 F ) in winter . Summers ( lasting from late April to June ) are mild , with maximum temperatures rarely crossing 25 \u00b0 C ( 77 \u00b0 F ) . The monsoon season from June to September is characterised by intense torrential rains often causing landslides that block Gangtok 's land access to the rest of the country . Rainfall starts to rise from pre @-@ monsoon in May , and peaks during the monsoon , with July recording the highest monthly average of 649 @.@ 6 mm ( 25 @.@ 6 in ) .

Snowfall is rare , and in recent times Gangtok has received snow only in 1990 , 2004 , 2005 and January 2011 . Temperatures below freezing are also rare . During this season the weather can be unstable , and change abruptly from bright sunshine and clear skies to heavy rain within a couple of hours . During spring and autumn the weather is generally sunny and mild . Owing to its elevation , Gangtok is often enveloped in fog during the monsoon and winter months ."

The second volcanic event produced a sequence of lavas and breccias on the eastern flank of the main ridge .

In his public art , Plensa challenged himself to involve the viewer with his art , which led to his conception of the Crown Fountain . His objective was to create a socially relevant , interactive fountain for the 21st century . Since water is the focus of a fountain , and since Chicago , and especially Millennium Park , is so greatly affected by the nearby waterfront , Plensa sought to create an eternal water work to complement the local natural inspirations . Because of the colder winters common to the climate of Chicago , Plensa created a fountain that would remain vibrant when the water was inactive in the wintertime , so the fountain is an experience of light themes and the use of video technology ."

Severtzov had been planning to describe the species as Passer ammodendri for several years and had been distributing specimens among other naturalists . When natural history dealer Charles Dode escaped from the Paris Commune in 1871 with some of his collection , Gould obtained specimens from a set of rare birds Dode exhibited to the Zoological Society of London . Severtzov did not describe the species until 1873 , and some later writers preferred to attribute him , but Gould 's description takes priority over Severtzov 's . The saxaul sparrow 's species name refers to its desert habitat , coming from the name of the Ammodendron or sand acacia tree , which is in turn derived from the Ancient Greek \u03ac\u03bc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 ( ammos , \" sand \" ) and \u03b4\u03ad\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd ( dendron , \" tree \" ) .

Some factions in the Commonwealth deemed this as an opportunity to shake free from decades of Russian control . That said , Prussia did not expect much from the alliance , not even that it would pass . When the treaty was first proposed to the Great Sejm by Prussian ambassador Ludwig Heinrich Buchholtz on 13 October 1788 , Prussians expected that it would cause long and fruitless debate which only outcome would be to ensure the weakening of Russian ( and to a lesser degree , Austrian ) position in Poland . Overall , for Prussia , the alliance with Poland was only one of several potential options ; but for some Polish politicians it became a new , and increasingly , only available strategy . The reception of Prussian proposal by the Sejm exceeded their expectations , and it has significantly strengthened the Patriotic Party . For the next year or so , Prussians decided to delay taking any clear action , keeping their options open . Buchholtz was also reprimanded for allowing things to go too far , and another Prussian diplomat , Girolamo Lucchesini , was sent to Warsaw to aid him ."

For example , the red of many sand deserts comes from laterite minerals . Geological processes in a desert climate can concentrate minerals into valuable deposits .

Similarly , evaporation tends to concentrate minerals in desert lakes , creating dry lake beds or playas rich in minerals .

They have their toes furnished with hard scales , and run with quickness , mostly among the rocks , where a man , however agile , can hardly catch them .

The Chinese of Teochew and Hakka heritage established gambier and pepper plantations in the 1870s and 1880s , and the White Rajah of Sarawak began to organise an administrative system for these plantations similar to the Kangchu system in Johor . The Kangchu of each plantation was appointed by the Charles Brooke , the then @-@ White Rajah . Each Kangchu was given responsibilities to oversee the operations of the plantations under his jurisdiction and the welfare of the coolies living there . In 1875 , the British promulgated a set of laws which defined the roles and responsibilities of the Kangchu ; they were modelled very closely to the Kanun Kangchu that was introduced by Sultan Abu Bakar of Johor in 1873 ."

The only differences he found between them were the development of the vertebrae , and the proportions of the limbs . During a study of dinosaurian ilia in the 1920s , Alfred Sherwood Romer proposed that the two orders of dinosaurs might have evolved separately , and that birds , based on the shape and proportions of their ilia might truly be specialized ornithischians . He used both Tyrannosaurus and Corythosaurus as a base model to analyze which theory is more likely true . He found that even though birds are thought of as saurischians , it is very plausible for them to have evolved their specific pelvic musculature and anatomy if they evolved from ornithschians like Corythosaurus . However , even though Corythosaurus does resemble modern birds in pelvic structure more than saurischians , birds are now thought to have descended from the latter ."

At 11 pm , Juan Per\u00f3n stepped on to the balcony of the Casa Rosada and addressed the crowd . Biographer Robert D. Crassweller claims that this moment was very powerful because it was very dramatic and recalled many important aspects of Argentine history . Crassweller writes that Juan Per\u00f3n enacted the role of a caudillo addressing his people in the tradition of Argentine leaders Rosas and Yrigoyen . Crassweller also claims that the evening contained \" mystic overtones \" of a \" quasi @-@ religious \" nature . Eva Per\u00f3n has often been credited with organizing the rally of thousands that freed Juan Per\u00f3n from prison on 17 October 1945 . This version of events was popularized in the movie version of the Lloyd Webber musical . Most historians , however , agree that this version of events is unlikely . At the time of Per\u00f3n 's imprisonment , Eva was still merely an actress . She had no political clout with the various labor unions , and it is claimed that she was not well @-@ liked within Per\u00f3n 's inner circle , nor was she liked by many within the film and radio business at this point . When Juan Per\u00f3n was imprisoned , Eva Duarte was suddenly disenfranchised . In reality , the massive rally that freed Per\u00f3n from prison was organized by the various unions , such as General Labor Confederation , or CGT as they came to be known . To this day , the date of 17 October is something of a holiday for the Justicialist Party in Argentina ( celebrated as D\u00eda de la Lealtad , or \" Loyalty Day \" ) . What would follow was shocking and nearly unheard of . The well connected and politically rising star , Juan Peron , married Eva . Despite Eva 's childhood illegitimacy , and having an uncertain reputation , Peron was in love with Eva , and her loyal devotion to him even while he had been under arrest touched him deeply , and so he married her , providing a respectability she had never known . Eva and Juan were married discreetly in a civil ceremony in Jun\u00edn on 18 October 1945 and in a church wedding on 9 December 1945 ."

The adaptive nature of ant colonies make it nearly impossible to eliminate entire colonies and most pest management practices aim to control local populations and tend to be temporary solutions . Ant populations are managed by a combination of approaches that make use of chemical , biological and physical methods .

This was effected by section 4 of the Immigration Ordinance 1971 of the British Indian Ocean Territory enacted pursuant to section 11 ( 1 ) of the British Indian Ocean Territory Order , which states : \" The Commissioner [ for the British Indian Ocean Territory ] may make laws for the peace , order and good government of the Territory , and such laws shall be published in such manner as the Commissioner may direct . \" The High Court held that the 1971 Ordinance was ultra vires the Order , since removing a people from their homeland could not be regarded as within the power to make laws for the territory 's \" peace , order and good government \" . Subsequently , the exclusion of the Chagossians from the land was reimposed by an Order in Council , the British Indian Ocean Territory ( Constitution ) Order 2004 , which was made in the exercise of the royal prerogative .

    "text": "According to sinologists Denis C. Twitchett and Klaus @-@ Peter Tietze , it is generally held that the Khitans emerged from the Yuwen branch of the Xianbei people . Following a defeat at the hands of another branch of the Xianbei in 345 , the Yuwen split into three tribes , one of which was called the Kumo Xi . In 388 the Kumo Xi itself split , with one group remaining under the name Kumo Xi and the other group becoming the Khitans . This view is partially backed up by the Book of Wei , which describes the Khitans as being of Xianbei origins . There are also several competing theories on the origin of the Khitans . Beginning in the Song dynasty , some Chinese scholars suggested that the Khitans might have descended from the Xiongnu people . While modern historians have rejected the idea that the Khitan were solely Xiongnu in origin , there is some support for the claim that they are of mixed Xianbei and Xiongnu origin . Beginning with Rashid @-@ al @-@ Din Hamadani in the fourteenth century , several Western scholars have theorized that the Khitans were Mongolic in origin , and in the late 19th century Western scholars made the claim that the Khitans were Tungusic in origin \u2014 modern linguistic analysis has discredited this claim ."
